# Productivity
A basic productivity tracker that records hours being productive each day and stores them in a csv file. 
Created and inspired by the book "Deep Work".
Created using knowledge from an introduction to computer programming class. 

Basic functions:
Display - shows recorded hours each day in a formatted bar graph. Also displays optional text next to each day.
Store in memory - stores a file in a memory file so that the program remembers which csv file to open.
Create - creates a new csv file to store hours, dates, and name of goal. 
Change goal - changes the csv file to be viewed.
Track - tracks the hours user was productive today. If the user inputs something more than once, the previous data is overwritten, otherwise the data is written to the file, in addition to the date.
